 In this course we needed to create psuedocode and a program for ABC University that read through a file, sorted it alphanumerically, and would allow the user to view all of the courses listed in the file or search for a specific one. For these projects, we had to determine which data structures would work best for the program based on run-time and space. I'm not that great with hash tables, so I should have chosen vectors or a binary search tree for my program, but I went with hash tables based on best and worst case run-time efficiency and space efficiency. I encountered several issues throughout the course where my code wouldn't compile, and it was generally due to a logic error such as a variable typo or a missed semicolon. The best way for me to overcome my issues was to take a small break from the problem, then come back later with a fresh mind. Staring at the same code for hours without a break was more likely to cause errors and make it harder to find them, so breaks were necessary. I don't know exactly if this project helped to expand or evolve my approach to software design or writing programs; I do not like C++ and I don't strive to work in software development when I graduate. It's still confusing for me, and I really didn't learn more about how C++ works in this course. I understand data structures more now, but that's about it.
